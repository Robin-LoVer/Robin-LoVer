Robin LoVer on Github
==

Hello! I am Robin Lopez. I am a hardware computer sciences undergraduate, but I've been programming since before college.

> - I specialize in general-purpose programming for end-user applications, but I also have worked with microcontrollers, IoT applications and design/control of machinery and electronics.

> - My main language is **Python** (which I use for everything), but I also work with **C** and **Java**. Currently I'm learning JavaScript and a lot of other related web-dev tools (TypeScript, Mongo, Angular, etc) for an academic research project.

> - Also a visual artist, I illustrate and design frequently for multiple personal projects.
