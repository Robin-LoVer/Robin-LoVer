Hello! I am Robin Lopez. I am a hardware computer sciences undergraduate, but I've been programming since before college.

> I specialize in general-purpose programming for end-user applications, but I also have worked with microcontrollers, IoT applications and design/control of machinery and electronics.

> My main language is Python (which I use for everything), but I also work with C (for microcontrollers) and Java. Currently I'm learning JavaScript and a lot of other related web-dev tools (TypeScript, Mongo, Angular, etc).

> Also a visual artist, I illustrate and design frequently for multiple personal projects.
